I spend so much time cleaning up hacked code from the internet, trying to understand what it's doing, that I might as well keep the fruits of my labor somewhere for future reference.

This is **not** a library. Code that's generic enough to work in any situation lends itself to unreadable spaghetti. This is a reference, a place to copy and paste from, and then re-format at will. The priority here is simplicity and readability.
