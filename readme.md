# Balloons

Balloons are simple. Remove weight to go up, deflate to go down. If you tie several of them together, you can fly.

This is **not** a library. Code that's generic enough to work in any situation lends itself to unreadable spaghetti. This is a reference, a place to copy and paste from and re-format at will. The priority is simplicity and readability.

I spend a lot of time cleaning up hacked code from the abandoned research codebases. I try to understand what the module is doing and then ruthlessly cut unnecessary sections. If you try to read PyTorch or fastai's code, you'll spend more time navigating files and weird class inheritances than looking at the core mathematical section of what's happening. They encourage plug-and-play, not understanding.
